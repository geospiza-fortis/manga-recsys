# manga-recsys recommendation

This is a project to build a semi-useful recommendation from mangadex's API.
There are other projects out there; this one is primarily for learning and fun.

## notes

### scraping

A list of all manga uuids (as of 2022-12-10) was graciously provided by tristan9 (thanks!).
If we do need to scrape this from scratch, we filter using the `createdAtSince` parameter and paginate according to limits set by the api.

```bash
# -a limit=10 for testing
scrapy runspider manga_recsys/scrapy/mangadex.py -a path=data/raw/2022-12-10-mangadex-uuid.csv -o data/raw/2022-12-10-mangadex-manga.ndjson -t jsonlines
```
